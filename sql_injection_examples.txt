First ran through your example code in the README file:
whatever' or '1'='1
' or password like 'a%
all the way up to 
' or password like 'e% 
which logged me in as Bill S Preston (another admin account)
It turned out I didn't need the username correct at all, just needed to run
through the passwords using the (' or password like 'a%) SQL code combinations

Next tried to learn more of Bill's password by doing
' or password like 'ea%
and was logged in as Bart Simpson
So now I had 2 different account usernames

I do see how Bill Preston's use of an ! could be helpful but if you have a program
that is running through every combination of every letter/number/character and getting
entry at each correct guess until they have the full thing, it seems almost useless

I was curious how a hacker would know when they had the full password and noticed
that entering 'or password like 'eatmyshorts% still logged me in. But maybe running through
all the combinations of eatmyshorts% would yield no further logins so they would
go back to eatmyshorts
